# Memory-Game
Springboard Exercise
## Simple color matching game 
### For this assignment, you’ll be building a memory game in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is to build a card-based memory game.
Players will be shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal what’s underneath.
After clicking on two cards, the game should check to see whether they match. If they do, they will remain facing up.
If not, the cards should remain displayed to the player for one second, and then flip back down.
The goal of the game is to match up all the pairs.
